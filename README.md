## Hello! 

I'm David. I'm currently working at Tektronix, adding features to and squashing bugs in applications running on Windows and Linux, primarily using C++ and Qt. I am also in the long process of building a banjo.

In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family, learning web development tools like React and ASP.NET, playing music, hiking, and building things out of wood.

Check out my pinned repositories for some samples of my personal projects.
